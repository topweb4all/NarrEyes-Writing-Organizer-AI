## AI Collaboration Statement: This project was developed with assistance from AI-based tools, primarily ChatGPTcd, which acted as a collaborative helper. The AI supported me by:
- Providing guidance on project structure and software architecture.
- Suggesting improvements in logic, workflow, and user experience.
- Helping generate boilerplate code and templates where needed.
- Offering explanations, debugging support, and optimization suggestions.

All creative decisions, core logic, and final implementation were authored, reviewed, and approved by me.
The AI served strictly as an auxiliary tool to enhance productivity, not as a substitute for my own work.
